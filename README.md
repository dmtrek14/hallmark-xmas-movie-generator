# hallmark-xmas-movie-generator
 A tiny website and some NLP magic to generate new Hallmark Christmas movies. For the initial version, I simply ran the NLP against a CSV manually and used the results to populate a json file, which the website pulls from. This is one of my first forays into playing with any of Python's NLP libraries. 

 Future enhancements: Refactor so that the button click will truly generate a movie title/summary on demand.
